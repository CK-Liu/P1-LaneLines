# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

## Writeup

### In this project we detected lane lines both in images and videos using Python and OpenCV. For a self-driving car, being able to detect the road is essential for the car to drive autonomously.

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

**Step 1:** First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I ....

**Step 2:** First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I ....

**Step 3:** First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I ....

**Step 4:** First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I ....

**Step 5:** First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I ....

**Step 6:** First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I ....

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...
